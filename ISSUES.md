### Issues
The following is a listing of problems remaining in this application.

1. The neural network model was never connected properly in favor of a simpler matrix factorization model; this was due to time constraints.

2.  Upon updating a movie rating from the Client page, this update does not immediately reflect on the Movie Information modal.

3. Current User is appended to the end of the datatable on the Admin Page.

4. Users without feedback are not searchable on the Admin Page.

5. Ratings do not show for searched users that were not loaded through getUsers()
